# CSR-Social-Sector-Analysis
Organizations invest heavily in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives across sectors such as Education, Healthcare, Environment, Rural Development, and Skill Development.
This project analyzes CSR project distribution across districts, states, and development sectors to identify high-impact areas, gaps, and regional imbalances.

The goal is to support data-driven CSR planning and decision-making using Excel and Power BI.
